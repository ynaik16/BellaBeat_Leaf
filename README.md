Data Analysis of Fitbit device to solve Business Task provided by BellaBeat

This case study has been an integral part of my journey in Google's Data Analyst certificate. This portfolio project has helped in applying all the fundamental concepts and techniques I had learned throughout this course.

In this project I have analyzed using R, a smart (wearable) device usage in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-BellaBeat smart devices like Fitbit or apple watch, etc. Further, I have selected one BellaBeat product (Leaf watch) to apply the create a comparison with the insights that I had gained, in order to provide recommendations to BellaBeat marketing team to increase sales of the product.
